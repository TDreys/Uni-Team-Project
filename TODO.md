TODO:

- ~~play sounds when certain actions occur~~
- ~~change maze creation to a better algorithm~~
- ~~change networking during lobby menu so clients can receive messages from server~~
- ~~add collision detection for walls and projectiles~~
- ~~switch sound on/off when the button is clicked in the options menu~~
- ~~make the server send a gameover message when the game is finished~~
- ~~add pause option to game state~~
- ~~add powerup collection~~ 
- ~~add resume option~~
- ~~creating a starting game state, create an algorithm to space the players evenly across the maze~~
- ~~add a heads up display~~
- ~~add highlight to tank corresponding to player so they can identify themselves~~
- ~~add sound effect for running out of fuel~~
- ~~SUGGESTION: make player move slower as fuel runs out, makes it less suprising~~
- ~~add wall around maze so players cant leave~~
- add a condition which prevents powerups appearing in the walls -Jinming
- ~~randomise the position of the powerups~~
- ~~make AI players aim at the player~~  
- use path finding to make ai go towards players - Yuning
- SUGGESTION: create a method in logichandler which takes an ai player and the gamestate and returns the inputs for the ai - Yuning
- ~~make AI players the same as player class, they have the same attributes but add a boolean isAI~~
- ~~getting hit by a projectile reduces health~~
- ~~user is eliminated when health reaches 0~~
- ~~add Gameover page~~
- ~~user can pick up powerups~~
- ~~each powerup has a different effect~~
- ~~each user has a certain amount of fuel~~
- ~~moving around uses fuel~~
- ~~users can get more fuel by collecting the fuel powerup or by returning to a refueling station~~ 
- ~~create AI players~~
- ~~add AI players to the game~~
- ~~Game mode design before next week~~
- ~~add animation for tanks dying and projectile collision~~
- ~~create ui for different gamemodes~~
- ~~add music when player is eliminated~~
- ~~add countdown until gamestart~~
- ~~fix bug where clicking the on button for the sound while the sound is on, repeats music~~
- ~~add gamestate creation for different gamemodes~~
- rescaling window -Tom

Video
- explain how the game works etc.


Report:

    - ~~any software engineering processes and principles used and adopted, development methodology used.~~
- ~~Risk analysis: - Davinder~~
    - ~~analysis of the risks associated with the chosen development methodology, software engineering practices, software design, etc.~~
- ~~Evaluation:~~
    - ~~an evaluation of the project: strengths and weaknesses. What has been learned, what could have been done better.~~
-	~~Summary~~

- Teamwork: - Everyone
    - An evaluation of how well the team worked together must be provided.
- Individual contributions: - Everyone
    - Each team member must submit a quantified evaluation of the contributions of all team members (including themselves). See below for more about this.
- Individual reflections: - Everyone
    - Each team member must write one side of a4 with their own reflections on the team and on their own contribution. These must all be included in the report.
- Compulsory appendix: 
    - the coding standards adopted by the team


- Test Report - Davinder (not JUnit test, only test table)
    - ~~The test report must include the test plan and the test results.~~ 
    - ~~The main body of this document should outline the testing strategy, the principles used, the test results, and any other relevant discussion about the testing. The test report should be included as an appendix to the main report.~~
    - The name of each JUnit test class should be provided in a list and included as an appendix. 
    - The main body of the document should also include details of the user testing undertaken, and the results of the user testing should be included as an appendix. 
    - ~~The test report must also include evidence of the coverage achieved by the tests.~~
